# workout_tracker

This was a project that I finished as part of a short online course on Vue.js and Supabase. It allows a registered user to create and update different workouts and log them. I was initially interested in learning more about Vue, but came away much more excited about Supabase.  Vue is great, but this project might have confirmed React as my one true love :)
